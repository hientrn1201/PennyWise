# PennyWise
## Inspiration
As college students, we understand the challenges of managing finances while living independently for the first time. It can be overwhelming to keep track of monthly expenses, bills, and student loan debt. It is a disappointment that so many of us struggle to stay afloat financially despite our best efforts. That's why we were inspired to create PennyWise - a next-generation budget management website application that empowers college students to take control of their finances and reach their financial goals.
## What it does
Our app offers three key services to help you take control of your finances: **Account Overview**, **Budgeting**, and **Education Debt Management**. With Account Overview, you can easily keep track of all your financial transactions in one place. Our Budgeting tool helps you plan your finances by monitoring your income and expenses, ensuring you stay within your financial limits and reach your goals. And, with Education Debt Management, we help you calculate the time it will take to pay off your student loans and plan your financial future with confidence.
## How we built it
We are proud to offer a solution that streamlines the budgeting process and helps college students reach their financial potential empowered by the most advanced and cutting-edge technology. Our server is powered by the **Express** and  **NodeJS** framework, while our authentication system uses the powerful **MongoDB** database. The user interface is designed with **HTML/CSS** to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience, with graphs generated by **Google Chart**. With our dedicated team, we aim to create a platform that is not only highly functional but also aesthetically pleasing.
To ensure the most accurate and up-to-date financial information, PennyWise integrates with **PlaidAPI** to bring you real-time financial data. This includes your account balance, spending, and student debt information, making it easier for you to keep track of your finances.
